# Readr.jl

Work in progress experimental helper functions to clean up the UI of standard data import tasks. The goal is to create an interface more suited to interactive use by data practicioners (similar to the R [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package) potentially at the cost of some performance in edge cases. Currently uses [uCSV.jl](https://github.com/cjprybol/uCSV.jl) as the backend.
